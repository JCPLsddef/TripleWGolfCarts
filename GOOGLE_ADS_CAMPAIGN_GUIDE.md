  - Lindale, TX
  - Whitehouse, TX

### Location Exclusions
Exclude these locations to reduce wasted spend:

### Advanced Settings
- **Target:** "People in or regularly in your targeted locations"
- **Exclude:** "People searching for your targeted locations" (prevents tourist searches)

## 7. BIDDING STRATEGY

### Day 1 Start: Manual CPC with Enhanced CPC

**Why:** With only $10/day budget and no conversion data, Manual CPC gives you control while Enhanced CPC helps optimize bids based on conversion likelihood.

**Settings:**
- **Bidding:** Manual CPC
- **Enhanced CPC:** ON
- **Starting Max CPC Bids:**
  - Ad Group 1 (Core Local): $3.00
  - Ad Group 2 (Events): $3.50
  - Ad Group 3 (Brand): $1.50

**Daily Monitoring (Days 1-14):**
- Check Search Impression Share (lost due to budget)
- If losing 50%+ impressions due to budget: Lower bids by $0.50
- If losing <20% impressions: Hold steady
- If not getting clicks: Increase bids by $0.50 (max $5.00)

---

### When to Switch: Maximize Conversions

**Timing:** After 30-50 conversions (approximately 30-60 days with $10/day)

**Why:** Maximize Conversions needs conversion data to work. With low budget, this takes time.

**Settings:**
- **Bidding:** Maximize Conversions
- **Target CPA:** DO NOT SET initially (let it learn)
- **After 50+ conversions:** Add tCPA of $30

**How to Switch:**
1. Go to Campaign Settings → Bidding
2. Change to "Maximize Conversions"
3. Leave Target CPA blank
4. Monitor daily for 7 days
5. If average CPL is <$25: Hold steady
6. If average CPL is $30-$40: Add tCPA of $30
7. If average CPL is >$40: Switch back to Manual CPC or pause low-performing keywords

---

### Budget Management

**If Budget is Consistently Maxed Out:**
- Review Search Terms daily
- Add more negative keywords aggressively
- Pause lowest-performing keywords (high CPC, low conversion rate)
- Consider lowering bids to stretch budget

**If Budget is NOT Being Spent:**
- Increase bids gradually ($0.50 increments)
- Expand to Phrase Match more aggressively
- Add more keywords from "Related Searches" in Google
- Check if ads are showing (low Quality Score issue?)

---

## 8. CONVERSION TRACKING CHECKLIST

### Primary Conversion: Form Submit

**Setup in Google Ads:**
1. Go to Tools & Settings → Measurement → Conversions
2. Click "+ New Conversion Action"
3. Select "Website"
4. Choose "Code yourself" or use Google Tag Manager

**Conversion Action Settings:**
```
Name: Quote Form Submit
Category: Submit lead form
Value: Use the same value for each conversion = $30
Count: One (only count one conversion per click)
Conversion window: 30 days
Include in Conversions: YES
Attribution model: Data-driven (or Last Click if data-driven unavailable)
```

**Website Implementation:**
- The website already has tracking infrastructure in place
- Event name: `form_submit_quote`
- Trigger: When user successfully submits quote form (Step 2 completion)

**Google Ads Conversion Tag:**
```html
<!-- Add to Quote Form Success State -->
<script>
  gtag('event', 'conversion', {
    'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/YOUR-CONVERSION-LABEL',
    'value': 30.0,
    'currency': 'USD'
  });
</script>
```

---

### Secondary Conversion: Phone Calls

**Two Types to Track:**

#### 1. Calls FROM Ads (Google Forwarding Number)
**Setup:**
- Enable Call Extensions (see section 6)
- Turn on Call Reporting
- Set minimum call length: 60 seconds
- Count calls as conversions: YES

**Conversion Action Settings:**
```
Name: Phone Call From Ad
Category: Phone call lead
Value: $30
Count: One per click
Conversion window: 30 days
```

#### 2. Calls FROM Website (After Ad Click)
**Setup:**
- Use Google Ads website call conversion tracking
- Requires: Google forwarding number OR call tracking service (CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics)

**Option A: Google Ads Phone Number Snippet**
```html
<!-- Add to all pages with phone number -->
<script>
gtag('config', 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/YOUR-CALL-CONVERSION-LABEL', {
  'phone_conversion_number': '(972) 965-6901',
  'phone_conversion_callback': function() {
    // Optional: track in your analytics
  }
});
</script>
```

**Option B: Use CallRail (Recommended for better attribution)**
- Sign up for CallRail ($30-45/month)
- Get dynamic phone number that tracks source
- Integrate with Google Ads for automatic conversion import

---

### GA4 + Google Ads Integration

**Step 1: Link Google Ads to GA4**
1. In GA4: Admin → Product Links → Google Ads Links
2. Choose your Google Ads account
3. Enable "Personalized advertising" and "Import conversions"

**Step 2: Import GA4 Events as Conversions**
1. In Google Ads: Tools → Measurement → Conversions
2. Click "+ New Conversion Action" → Import → Google Analytics 4
3. Select these events:
   - `form_submit_quote` (primary)
   - `phone_call_click` (secondary)
   - `form_start` (for optimization, mark as secondary)

**Step 3: Set Conversion Values**
- Form Submit: $30
- Phone Call Click: $30
- Form Start: $0 (secondary action, don't count in CPL)

---

### Enhanced Tracking for Optimization

**Track These Events (But Don't Count as Conversions):**

1. **Form Start**
   - Event: `form_start`
   - When: User clicks on rental dates field
   - Use for: Understanding drop-off rates

2. **Form Step 1 Complete**
   - Event: `form_step_completed`
   - When: User completes rental details and clicks "Continue"
   - Use for: Optimizing form flow

3. **Phone Number Click**
   - Event: `click_call_now`
   - When: User clicks any "Call Now" button
   - Use for: Understanding call intent

**Why Track These:**
- Helps identify which ads drive the most engaged traffic
- Shows where users drop off in conversion funnel
- Allows for optimization even before conversions happen

---

### Call Duration Tracking (Advanced)

**To accurately track call quality:**

**Minimum Call Length:**
- Set to 60 seconds for ad call conversions
- Reasoning: <60 seconds = likely wrong number or quick hang-up

**Adjust Based on Data:**
- After 50+ calls, review call recordings (if using CallRail)
- If most qualified leads last 90+ seconds: Increase minimum to 90
- If you're missing conversions: Lower to 45 seconds

---

## 9. 7-DAY OPTIMIZATION PLAN

### Daily Tasks (10 minutes/day)

**Day 1-3: Data Gathering Mode**
- Check: Total spend vs. budget ($10 target)
- Check: Are ads showing? (Search for your own keywords in incognito)
- Check: Any clicks yet? If no clicks by Day 3 → Increase bids $0.50
- Check: Search Terms Report for irrelevant queries
- Action: Add 3-5 negative keywords daily from Search Terms

**Day 4-7: Initial Optimization**
- **Check Search Terms Report:**
  - Any "for sale" or "buy" queries? → Add as negatives
  - Any irrelevant locations? → Add location exclusions
  - Any low-intent queries? → Add as phrase match negatives

- **Check Keyword Performance:**
  - Any keywords with 20+ impressions but 0 clicks? → Increase bid by $0.50
  - Any keywords with 10+ clicks but no conversions? → Monitor (too early to pause)

- **Check Quality Score:**
  - Any keywords with QS < 5? → Review ad relevance
  - Ensure ad headline includes keyword
  - Make sure landing page mentions keyword

---

### Week 2: Aggressive Negative Keyword Management

**Goal:** Protect your $10/day budget from wasted clicks

**Search Terms to Negate Immediately:**
- Anything containing: repair, parts, for sale, buy, used, jobs
- Wrong rental types: car rental, RV rental, boat rental
- Informational queries: "how to", "diy", "what is"
- Free/cheap/discount queries

**How to Add Negatives:**
1. Campaign → Keywords → Search Terms
2. Check boxes next to irrelevant terms
3. Click "Add as negative keyword"
4. Select "Campaign" level (applies to all ad groups)
5. Choose match type: Exact for specific terms, Phrase for broader blocking

**Target:** Add 10-15 negative keywords in Week 2

---

### Week 3: Keyword & Ad Optimization

**Pause Keywords If:**
- 30+ clicks with 0 conversions → Pause (re-evaluate in 2 weeks)
- CPC > $6 consistently → Pause (too expensive for $10/day budget)
- Low Quality Score (<4) with high CPC → Pause and review ad/landing page

**Keep Keywords If:**
- Any conversions (even 1)
- High CTR (>5%) even without conversions yet
- Quality Score > 6

**Ad Optimization:**
- Review Ad Strength (should be "Good" or "Excellent")
- If "Poor" or "Average":
  - Add more unique headlines
  - Ensure headlines include keywords
  - Add more specific descriptions

---

### Week 4: Bid Adjustments & Budget Allocation

**Check Performance by Ad Group:**
```
Best Case Scenario (Good Performance):
Ad Group 1: 60% of budget, 2+ conversions → GOOD
Ad Group 2: 30% of budget, 1+ conversion → GOOD
Ad Group 3: 10% of budget, 1+ conversion → GOOD

Worst Case Scenario (Poor Performance):
Ad Group 1: 80% of budget, 0 conversions → PROBLEM
Ad Group 2: 15% of budget, 0 conversions → PROBLEM
Ad Group 3: 5% of budget, 0 conversions → OK (brand)
```

**Actions Based on Performance:**

**If Ad Group 1 (Core Local) has 0 conversions after 4 weeks:**
1. Check landing page - is it loading fast?
2. Test phone number - does it work?
3. Review Search Terms - are they truly high-intent?
4. Lower bids to $2.00 and focus budget on Ad Group 2

**If Ad Group 2 (Events) outperforms Ad Group 1:**
1. Shift more budget to Ad Group 2 (increase bids)
2. Add more event-related keywords
3. Create separate ad groups for "wedding golf cart rental" and "rv park golf cart"

### Weekly Checklist (Every Sunday)

**Week 1-4:**
- [ ] Review total spend (should be ~$70 per week)
- [ ] Check total conversions and calculate CPL
- [ ] Review Search Impression Share Lost (budget)
- [ ] Add 5-10 new negative keywords
- [ ] Check phone is working (call your own number)
- [ ] Review Search Terms Report for new keyword ideas
- [ ] Adjust bids based on performance

**CPL Checkpoints:**
- Week 2: Target 1-2 conversions ($35-70 CPL = acceptable early on)
- Week 4: Target 3-5 conversions ($56-93 CPL = still learning)
- Week 8: Target 8-10 conversions ($56-$70 CPL = getting there)
- Month 3: Target 10-12 conversions per month ($25-30 CPL = GOAL)

---

### When to Pause Keywords

**Pause Immediately If:**
- Keyword triggers "for sale" or "buy" searches (add negative instead)
- CPC spikes above $8 (budget killer)
- Quality Score drops to 1-2 (ad or landing page issue)

**Pause After 2 Weeks If:**
- 50+ clicks with 0 conversions
- CPC consistently above $5 with no signs of conversion

**Pause After 4 Weeks If:**
- 30+ clicks with 0 conversions
- CTR < 1% (low relevance)

**NEVER Pause If:**
- Keyword has generated even 1 conversion
- Keyword has <10 clicks (too early to tell)

---

### How to Protect Your $30 CPL Target

**Daily Budget Management:**
```
$10/day = 3.33 clicks at $3 CPC
Goal: 1 conversion per every 3-4 clicks (33% conversion rate)
Reality: 1 conversion per 10-15 clicks (6-10% conversion rate) is more realistic

With 10% conversion rate:
$10/day × 30 days = $300/month
10 conversions per month = $30 CPL ✅

With 5% conversion rate:
$300/month ÷ 5 conversions = $60 CPL ❌ TOO HIGH
```

**If CPL is Trending Above $30:**

**Action 1: Add More Negative Keywords**
- Target: 50+ negative keywords in first month
- Focus on non-converting search terms

**Action 2: Pause Low-Converting Keywords**
- If keyword has 20+ clicks and 0 conversions → Pause for 2 weeks

**Action 3: Lower Bids on High-CPC Keywords**
- If CPC >$4 → Lower bid by $0.50
- Monitor impression share - if dropping below 50% → Adjust targeting instead

**Action 4: Focus on Phone Conversions**
- Calls typically convert at higher rates than forms
- Ensure call extension is showing
- Highlight phone number in ads

**Action 5: Improve Landing Page (Last Resort)**
- Ensure phone number is visible above fold
- Test adding pricing to reduce low-quality leads
- Ensure fast load time (<2 seconds)

---

### What SUCCESS Looks Like After 30 Days

**Good Performance Metrics:**
- 8-12 conversions per month
- $25-35 CPL

**Average Performance Metrics:**
- 5-8 conversions per month

## FINAL TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Be Patient:** With $10/day, expect slow ramp-up. First conversion may take 5-10 days.

2. **Prioritize Phone Calls:** They convert faster than forms. Make sure call extension is active.

3. **Ruthless on Negatives:** Your $10 budget can't afford wasted clicks. Add negatives daily.

4. **Monitor Search Terms Daily:** This is your #1 optimization lever in the first 2 weeks.

5. **Don't Pause Too Early:** Keywords need 20-30 clicks before you can judge performance.

6. **Quality Score Matters:** If QS is <5, fix it before increasing bids. Better ads = lower CPC.

7. **Mobile Matters:** 60%+ of clicks will be mobile. Ensure your site loads fast and phone number is clickable.

8. **Track Everything:** Conversions, calls, form starts, search terms. More data = better decisions.

9. **Local Intent is King:** Focus on "Tyler TX" and "East Texas" keywords first. Expand slowly.

10. **Test and Iterate:** Try different ad copy, adjust bids, test new keywords. Improve 1% per week = 50% better by year end.
